# Product Guidelines

## Communication & Voice
- **Tone:** The AI's voice is shaped by custom system prompts handcrafted by the developer to ensure a specific, high-quality pedagogical experience.
- **Instructional Style:** Prioritize the Socratic method and first-principles thinking. Focus on breaking complex topics into their fundamental components.
- **Brand Message:** "Let's build your understanding from the ground up."

## Design & User Experience (UX)
- **Visual Aesthetic:** Minimalist and distraction-free foundation, incorporating specific developer preferences for a polished, personal feel.
- **Interaction Model:** Real-time, streaming responses for immediate feedback. Deep integration of rich media (LaTeX, code) for technical clarity.
- **Learning Environment:** The UI should facilitate deep study, with tools for active recall and concept drill-down easily accessible but non-intrusive.

## Content & Quality
- **Information Depth:** Build knowledge from the ground up. Start with the most basic axioms and progress to complex synthesis.
- **Proven Frameworks:** Implement techniques like the Feynman Technique and Socratic Tutoring as core, interactive product features.
- **Model Agnostic Consistency:** Ensure a consistent "OpenBook" experience regardless of the underlying LLM provider through unified prompting and UI standards.
