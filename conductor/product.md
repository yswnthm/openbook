# Initial Concept
An AI-powered knowledge exploration platform providing an interactive interface for information search, AI conversations, and academic research.

# Product Vision
OpenBook is a first-principles learning platform designed to help students and enthusiasts master complex concepts through deep understanding rather than rote memorization. It leverages multiple AI models and proven pedagogical frameworks to guide users from search to fundamental knowledge.

# Target Users
- **General Purpose Students:** Learners across disciplines who want to understand the "why" and "how" behind what they are studying.
- **Lifelong Enthusiasts:** Individuals driven by curiosity who prefer learning through first principles and rigorous exploration.
- **Academic Researchers:** Users who require high-quality information retrieval coupled with structured synthesis tools.

# Core Features
- **First-Principles Learning Tools:** Features specifically designed to break down complex topics into their fundamental components.
- **Study Framework Integration:** Built-in support for proven learning techniques like the Feynman Technique, Active Recall, and Socratic Tutoring.
- **Multi-Model Intelligence:** Access to a variety of LLMs (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.) to get different perspectives on a single concept.
- **Interactive Knowledge Interface:** A rich, streaming environment supporting LaTeX, code, and file attachments for a comprehensive learning experience.
- **Research & Discovery:** Advanced search capabilities for both casual web inquiries and scholarly paper exploration.
- **Interactive Onboarding:** A guided, step-by-step introduction to help users quickly master the platform's advanced research and learning features.

# Success Metrics
- User adoption of specific study frameworks (e.g., Feynman Technique sessions).
- Depth of interaction within concept-drilling conversations.
- Positive user feedback regarding concept mastery and retention.
